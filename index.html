                <p>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition 
                    and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. 
                    I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! 
                    I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was 
                    the  best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                    the course, I’ve  successfully switched careers, working as a Software 
                    Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never 
                    had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, 
                    was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no 
                    tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during 
                    interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly 
                    helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple 
                    offers. 100% recommend!  ”</p>
